I created this Python project using Flet to build a simple task list application.
You can use it to add, check, and manage your tasks easily.

âš¡ Features:

Add new tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Clean and simple interface

ðŸ’¡ Note:
I'm a beginner in programming. This is my 3rd project, and I'm excited to keep learning and improving!
